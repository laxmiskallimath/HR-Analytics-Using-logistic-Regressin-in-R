Project 2:- Employee Attrition In an Multinational Company Using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
                  Objective:- To determine the factors contributing to employe attrition
1)	As a part of Certification ,we collaborated with Employee attrition in an multinational company to predict what are the major factors affecting employee attrition 
2)	We built Logistic regression model and Decision tree model (CART and Chaid model)on this employee attrition data 
3)	Employee attrition data has around 1470 observation and 33 variables ,out of 1470 observations 16% employees are more prone to attrition 
4)	Here also we did basic EDA on overall data ,split the data in to train and test data  built the model  got an accuracy of 86% in logit model,88% in CART model and around 86% in Chaid model.
5)	Here our main objective was to find out variables which are making major impact on attrition rate 
6)	From all three model we found variables like Overtime,Distnce from home, Business travel, Environment satisfaction ,Job involvement, Job level made huge impact on attrition .
